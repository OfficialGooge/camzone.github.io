		If a file has .min in it, it means it is minifed. This means that the file is
		all on one line. This is done so the browser loads it faster, it can process
		the code faster if it's on the same line.

		It's good practice to always include minified files, the only exception is when
		the website is in development and a file is constantly being changed. Obviously
		changing a file while it's minified is alot harder than non-minified.
